## Project Title: ThreadOh!!!

## Description:

The idea of this project is very similar to that of Twitter and Reddit. At its core it is a personal blog where users and individuals can create posts. These posts can than be seen by other users. Users can also respond to the post through the use of comments. In addition, the application also has threads which are basically dicussion boards or forums where they focus on one specific topic such as games, shows, movies or whatever the user wants to create. The application can keep track of likes as well as the number of comments for a specific post. Users can create an account anc keep track of the posts, comments, and threads they have created. If a user finds a specific thread or post they want to keep track of, they can bookmark posts and also join different threads which are kept tracked in their profile.

## Installation

-- What technologies did the application require in order to run smoothly and effectively?--

The application is a Full-Stack application that mostly follows the MERN stack flow. However, instead of MongoDB as its database handler, this uses MySql as its database. Other than that, the application uses React as its front-end library, and uses Node and Express to create the logic as well as the fetch and call request respecitvely. The application uses pure CSS for its design but takes icons from Material UI, a CSS framework.

The application is hosted by two different services. The database server or back end is hosted by heroku while the front end is hosted by Github Pages.
